    "text": "1 Introduction\nEvery year the ILEO core team presents final projects that the students work on for much of their class time. The projects detail the rules for the specific project, as well as arena layout information, tips, etc.\nThese are the base rules that apply to all projects. Many have appeared in other ILEO communications or documents, now they have a permanent home here. Projects typically omit these for brevity and to avoid confusion or understanding of the project-specific rules.\nRules here are to ensure fairness of the competition. Some are common sense and others may seem overly formal in the interest of explicitness and clarity.\nProjects may explicitly override the rules here in certain situation. In such cases, follow the guidance in the project. If we left some ambiguity, please reach out to the core team so we can clarify the situation if needed.\nThis document will likely evolve, so please refer to the current copy at the start of a new ILEO season. This document is online at the ILEO Box site (https://ibm.ent.box.com/ILEO-Project) in the ‘TODO’ folder.",

    "text": "Rule\nNotes/Why\nID\n\n\n\n\nA team's solution to the final project may only use the LEGO® parts from one LEGO Robotics kit. The kits typically in use in the ILEO program:\n\nLEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT Education #9797 (any of the 3 revisions)\nLEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Education #45544\nLEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime #45678\n\nOther variations of these kits, and LEGO robot generations exist. The home/retail versions we generally allow. We may limit certain parts in those kits to avoid giving an unfair advantage. You may add parts to bring retail kits in line with the education kits.\nFor details, see the 'Kit Compatibility Statement.pdf' in the 'Tips, tools, and hints' folder. In it we explain the differences between the kits and what we will and will not allow at the final competition. It will also explain rules for parts swaps allowed between kits. The document is in the ILEO box folder.\nNo other non_LEGO style/brand of robot is eligible for competition in our program.\nStudents might compete against students with different kits. Minimizing those differences keeps competition fair.\nStandard kits control costs so the schools.\nThe education version of the kit is the gold standard. Some schools have purchased the retail version of the kits in the past. Such kits are legal at the competition, with the restrictions listed in the document.\n Coaches, replace lost or broken parts in the kits. Ideally all LEGO robotic kits given to the students are complete as if new at the beginning of the season. Get parts from the LEGO group, other sources, or take them from unused kits. Its often useful to select a \"parts\" kit you can raid, but you'll quickly run out of certain parts.\nMentors may remove easily lost (e.g. small gears), expensive to replace, or distracting (tank treads, rubber bands) parts. Please make those materials available to teams upon request if they have a legitimate need for their project.\nKIT-01\n\n\nOnly parts with a LEGO Group part number designed to connect to standard LEGO bricks or LEGO TECHNIC™ parts (including the wire and battery cover) No bins, lids, manuals, manuals are valid for use. \nSaid another way, components in the box which are not LEGO pieces (such as the instruction booklet, the part trays, sticker sheet and packaging) are NOT allowed as part of the team's solution. The intelligent brick, sensors, and wires ARE LEGO parts. If there is any question contact the core team ASAP. You may ask a judge at the competition, but that might be too late to correct any issue.\nCreative uses of these parts may be an advantage, disruptive to the competition, or damaging to reusable things in the kit.\nPARTS-01\n\n\n\nDo not modify or damage parts of the kit in preparing your project for competition, or for other in-class activities.\n\nAvoid damage to reusable parts of kits for use by future students. Avoid advantage given by non-LEGO parts.\nPARTS-02",

We strongly encourage students who have participated in the program in the past move from beginner to standard.\n\nStandard\n\nOpen to elementary and middle school students.\n\nAdvanced\n\nOpen to all students, this is the only level that high school students can compete at.\n\nAdvanced is hard. If your students have not been in the ILEO program before, we do not recommend placing them in the Advanced division unless they are familiar with the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® platform and have solid problem-solving skills.\nIf you are not sure, but the students really want to try, have them do the Advanced weekly projects. If they do well there, they will likely be OK with the long-term projects.\n\n\n\nWe'd like the competition to be even. The number and size of divisions affects the materials the ILEO core team needs to prepare for the competition. It also affects the complexity and timeliness of scoring for the competition.\nDIV-01\n\n\nWe expect teachers/mentors/classes to familiarize students with the concepts in the ILEO curriculum documents in the iLEO box folder. Admittedly the documents work better for older students due to the reading level and the amount of reading.\nYou have flexibility in how to present these materials, especially for younger students. Though typically classes work directly from the documents. We also do not expect you to finish the documents, but you should finish material that covers all sensors, or at least the sensors needed for the final project.\nThe curriculum has the building blocks students will need in preparing their solutions to the final project, this year and beyond. We also hope to teach the students about engineering as a discipline and career.\nCURR-01",

    "text": "2.3 Robot Behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule\nNotes/Why\nID\n\n\n\n\nAll robots/programs must run autonomously. That is, once you start the program, the robot must complete the task on its own without any human intervention. Touching the robot typically stops the run. Certain kinds of interference or project rules might disqualify the run.\nFor example, you may not maintain a Bluetooth or other connection (long stick) to the robot to communicate with it or\nThis makes projects easier to solve, so we want everyone to face the same challenges and make the competition fair. We want to encourage creative builds and programming solutions.\nAUTO-01\n\n\nStart your program on the robot using buttons or sensors on the robot.\nRelated to the previous rule about autonomous robots. Also, we're uncertain about interference that many Bluetooth connections might cause. It also makes it clearer to the judge when to start timing your run.\nSTART-01\n\n\nNo one may interfere with the robots of the teams they are competing against.\nFairness.\nAUTO-02\n\n\nIf a robot interferes with a robot in another arena by accident in the longer term competition, the just may give the affected team(s) another run. For short term, this depends on the specific project: two robots to be operating near each other is more common in short term..\nTo save floor space and materials, we generally place 2 arenas together. One 4 foot by 8 foot area typically hosts two teams doing judged runs at the same time. We generally design projects to its unlikely either run will interfere with the other. But robot designs, or a malfunctioning robot that can reach over the 2×4 walls could interfere.\nAUTO-03\n\n\nTypically, before a run starts, the robot must fit in the bounds of an 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch (US Letter) piece of paper. Some projects may specify different dimensions. The wires that connect motors and sensors may go beyond the boundaries as tying them down is difficult and may damage the wires. The wires must still fit in the bounds when you press/squish the wires inward toward the robot.\nOnce the robot's program starts, the robot may unfold or transform by itself. The robot may then become larger than stated dimensions.\n\nSome of our projects are too easy to solve with a large or wide robot. Unfolding adds a challenge in build in programming to be fair to students with other solutions.\n\nSIZE-01\n\n\nIf a project does not include a wall around the area (typically made of 2×4s ), the robot may leave the arena and return to it during a run. It should not go far beyond the surface more than a foot, or at the discretion of the judges. Its best to warn the judge and prepare the ground if you plan for your robot to drive around the arena.\nIf a project has a wall, we do not want robots leaving the arena area enclosed, unless explicitly allowed by the project.\nThe surface of the competition is generally like a gym floor, but it may be inconsistent when compared to our whiteboard arenas. The competition floor is likely different than the floor when you practice with. That could affect the behavior of your robot.\nAlso, our arena surfaces typically have a 1/8 inch drop to the floor. Students should be familiar with that, assuming the class uses our standard arena materials. Your robot will need to traverse that. This could be a problem for robots with a \"plow\" that scrapes the surface or otherwise has low-hanging parts.\nAt times during the competition there may be people, judges or other materials around the arena. We'd like to allow creative solutions that leave the arena, but we need to limit chaos and interference that results from the robots driving around. Its also hard to tell if a robot is out of control or purposely driving away.\nWhen a project has walls, typically at the competition there will be another arena surface an team competing. We do not want teams competing near each other to interfere with each other.\nAUTO-04",

    "text": "2.4 Arenas and Project Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule\nNotes/Why\nID\n\n\n\n\nThe arenas that we use at the final competition are not (for the most part) new. They often have faint pencil marks or other minor blemishes from previous competitions. The arena walls are not perfectly smooth (the lumber may contain knots).\nWe do avoid using any arena which has blemishes that we deem it would interfere with the solution to the project. Students should be tolerant of slight blemishes on the surface like light pencil marks. Most robots have no problem tolerating these, but if your students have tolerances so tight that light pencil marks interfere with the functioning of the robot, we ask that you encourage them to loosen their tolerances.\nWe reuse materials for cost reasons (as we encourage schools to do). This is not to say the arenas at the competition are poor quality, just that they're not perfect/new. Its also important to not the arenas at the competition are not exactly the same as the onces you used in class.\n\n\n\nNo one may not touch arena materials during a run.\nStopping a ball from rolling, removing an item could make the robot's job easier, or give an unfair scoring advantage to a team.\n\n\n\nParticipants may not damage project materials or arenas on purpose. Do not build or code robots to damage materials.\nWe need to reuse parts for all teams, and not interrupt the competition flow and finish on time.\nDMG-01\n\n\nTODO this whole section needs editing, might need to be broken up, or maybe in its own table.\nMany projects depend on the position of the robot, or items on the board being at a certain position for scoring. Cases include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe robot or an item being \"in\" or \"within\" a certain area.\nThe robot or item crosses/enters/leaves a boundary.\n\nin vs completely in Crossing a tape line or entering an area of an arena are based on looking from above the arena straight down.\nCrossing an obstacle means that the intelligent brick has moved entirely outside of the shaded area shown in the diagram above, after having crossed from one side to the other\n\"Behind a tape line\" or \"crossing a tape line\" means that the Intelligent brick of the robot is not on top of any part of the tape line, as viewed from above.\nFor projects with specific scoring zones, the robot or item must be over the zone. If some part of puck is over the space of a scoring zone (excluding tape), judge award those points. If the puck is over multiple scoring zones, the points from lowest zone will be used.\nSome projects require a robot or some item the robot interacts with to be at a specific place or stop at a specific place by the end of a run. The judge will look straight down from above the arena and ensure the item or robot is over/inside/past the specified boundary.\nA robot stopping in a certain position depends on the position of the robot's Intelligent brick only, not the rest of the body of the robot.\nProjects where the robot body is considered legal for the stop rule is similar to the rule for the robot fitting within the bounds of a US Letter piece of paper at the beginning of a run for some projects. The \"wire squishing\" guidance also applies here.\nLEGO® parts not attached to the body of the robot are ignored for purposes of the position of the robot.\nAvoid ambiguity and disallow (or allow) certain clever solutions that would make it too easy to achieve the related rule or score.\nPOS-01\n\n\nWhat it means for an item (e.g. PVC peg, domino) to be considered \"knocked over\". This is easy if the peg is on its side, on the arena surface, or on the floor off of the arena surface. The item could catch on a wall, robot, or other materials in the arena. Imagine if the item the peg is in contact with disappeared, would the peg fall over on its own and make full contact with the arena floor? If this is not clear, a judge will make a ruling.\nThis makes projects easier to solve, so we want everyone to face the same challenges and make the competition fair. We want to encourage creative builds and programming solutions.\n\n\n\nObjects might still be moving after the team has declared a stop to their run. Judges will not score the run until the object either stop, or come to some state where the scoring is less ambiguous at the judge's discretion.\nJudges typically won't be able to catch the state of all the scored objects at exactly the time the students stop the run. We don't have \"instant replay\". The judge also must pay attention to the trial time and stop the stopwatch. And the state of the objects upon stop is something that teams should consider in how their solution works.\n\n\n\nTeams may not move items on the arena before they start a run. Once the robot starts, it may move anything on the arena not fastened down (and as not to cause damage as in DMG-01). Scoring rules in the project will tell you what you should or should not move.\nMay give teams an advantage. We want teams to be solving similar problems.",

Materials your team must bring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule\nNotes/Why\nID\n\n\n\n\nReturn your signed release forms at the competition when you sign in! You may return forms any time up to the start of judging. students participating in the competition must submit a signed release form.\nAlso Note: Rochester Public Education is a co-sponsor of the final competition, which is why their name appears next to IBM's name on the release form. All students, whether they are from a school in the Rochester Public Education system or not, need to submit a signed release form.\nThe invited local media may be taking photographs or video at the event, sharing the story on TV, online or in print. Regular participants may also do the same. We encourage this to grow awareness of our program and encourage students to join and others to volunteer via these materials.\nIf you cannot appear in such materials, do not attend the competition. Other members of your team should present your solution to the judges.\nChecking with every student for permission during the event is not realistic. Those taking photographs may be unaware of the issue.\nParticipants confused about the \"Rochester Public Education\" verbiage on the form did not submit the required forms in the past.\nPHOTO-01\n\n\nIf you are planning on bringing a practice arena to the final competition, do not transport the arena on a school bus. You may get a ticket for unsecured cargo. You may also have to make other hasty arrangements to get your materials legally to the venue.\nThis has actually happened to a school in the ILEO program.\nMAT-01\n\n\nParticipants in the Advanced final project will place their robots in the designated garage area. Please do this once you've located your seating area and have unpacked your robot.\nAfter competing, you may take your robot back to your table. You'll need it for the short-term round of the competition.\nSome advanced arena layouts are not revealed until the final competition. We don't want teams to adjust their robot build or program once they've seen the final layout. Advanced students ready to complete when they arrive is our expectation.\n\n\n\nPlease remember that we do not allow programming of robots during the long-term competition. We ask that students check light levels and make any necessary last-minute adjustments to their robot before the competition begins. The final version of their program is ready to go, loaded on the robot, preferably before even arriving at the venue.\nWe require \"laptops closed\" at competition start. If a team is programming after competition begins, the team may present their solution to the judge as scheduled, but they may not place in the competition results.\nParticipants that compete later would have an unfair time advantage to complete or tweak their work.\n\n\n\nNote a rule, but a best practice/reminder. Have your students make sure that their robots are fully charged on the day of the competition. Also have them make sure that they have the final version of their program loaded on the robot.\nWould be unfortunate if a team could not compete to its potential due to lack.\n\n\n\nRemind students to be careful with their robots! We have had students drop their robot on the way to the arena for judging. The competition runs on a tight schedule, and we do not have extra slots to allow a team to compete outside of their assigned time. Reassembling damaged robots counts against the team's available competition time. Judges will not pause stop watches while students repair their robots.\nCan ruin a student's experience.\n\n\n\nRemind your students to watch the power cables! We have cables running under all the tables to provide power to laptops and kits. These cables connect together in series. Every year someone will trip on a cable and accidentally unplug other table, without realizing it. If you suddenly lose power, do a quick check to see if your extension cord has become unplugged. Many of the laptops loaned out by IBM have unreliable batteries, so this can be a big problem if it happens during the short-term competition prep time.\nUnplugging power is disruptive to the teams.\n\n\n\nWe ask that you be respectful of the RCTC staff and keep the gymnasium as clean as possible. Encourage your students to be courteous. We are going to have a large number of students in the Field House, and we want to keep this a positive experience for everybody.\nRelatives/guests are welcome to attend and observe the competition, we only ask that they give room to the competing teams and to judges when spectating. A fence separates the competition area from the rest of the venue. We ask that only competing teams (or teams that are about to compete) and their coaches be in the competition area. Relatives may come into the competition area to take photographs, but we ask that they maintain a respectful distance so as not to interfere with the competition.\nEnsure a good experience for all attending the competition.\n\n\n\nStudents and mentors must understand the full rules of a project and this document. Reach out to the ILEO core team is anything is unclear well before the competition to answer any questions, or for a ruling in case other schools/teams have the same questions. Judges and the ILEO core team have the ultimate say in interpreting the rules or handling unexpected situations at the competition.\nWe try to make rules as clear and unambiguous as we can. But sometime language might fail us might be inadvertently confusing. If there is any confusion, and you interpret things differently in class, we cannot honor such interpretations at the competition to ensure a level playing field.\nWe also want students to be responsible for read and understand the rules so their solutions conform. Students should ask for mentor help as needed. Mentors should reach out to the core team as needed.\n\n\n\nIBMers: Please consider wearing an IBM shirt at the final competition.\nMentors/teachers consider the same for any other organizations that support your program.\nShow your company pride!

We do trust our judges to be fair and make a few mistakes as possible.\n\n\n\nStudents must bring their team name slip from the packet distributed on check-in to the competition. Mentors must pass these out and remind students to bring them.\nThis slip tells students what time and arena they compete. It helps judges ensure the scoring is correct.\n\n\n\nCertain projects (typically short-term) the judge will give the team a slip that indicates the students will compete.\n\n\n\n\nJudges would appreciate student help in resetting arenas for the next run. Students must wait for permission from the judge first. Follow the project rules while resetting the arena. The judge may hold the next run until a judge or student corrects the issue.\n\nThis speeds up the reset time, possibly giving students more time to perform their runs. But we want the reset performed fairly. Also, the judge needs a few moments to correctly score the run before the arena is reset and the next run can start.\n\n\n\n\nDuring a run, a robot might malfunction or parts may otherwise disconnect. After judges score the run, but before the next run begins, students may reassemble the robot. Time will continue running for timed projects. For non-timed projects, we expect reassembly in a timely manner.\nTeams can't be successful on the next run with a broken robot, but we need to balance the time involved to keep the competition as a whole moving.\n\n\n\nDo not bring Laptops, tablets or other programming devices to the competition arenas. I.e. students may not change their programs while competing.\nStudents may encounter things they didn't expect. The time it takes to change the program, and test the robot will likely take too much time.\nFor certain projects, knowledge of the arena layout at the project could give student and advantage (typically for the Advanced division).\n\n\n\nJudges can provide students information on their final score, but only the scoring official has the complete results.The judges and ILEO core team do not provide complete competition results to teams upon completion of the competition, other than the top final rankings in each division.\nWe don't have the resources to provide scoring or ranking details to the teams.
