<li>LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime #45678</li>

<p>Other variations of these kits, and LEGO robot generations exist. The home/retail versions we generally allow. We may limit certain parts in those kits to avoid giving an unfair advantage. You may add parts to bring retail kits in line with the education kits.</p>
<p>For details, see the 'Kit Compatibility Statement.pdf' in the 'Tips, tools, and hints' folder. In it we explain the differences between the kits and what we will and will not allow at the final competition. It will also explain rules for parts swaps allowed between kits. The document is in the ILEO box folder.</p>
<p>No other non_LEGO style/brand of robot is eligible for competition in our program.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>Students might compete against students with different kits. Minimizing those differences keeps competition fair.</p>
<p>Standard kits control costs so the schools.</p>
<p>The education version of the kit is the gold standard. Some schools have purchased the retail version of the kits in the past. Such kits are legal at the competition, with the restrictions listed in the document.</p>
<p><!-- vale alex.Condescending["easily"] = NO --> Coaches, replace lost or broken parts in the kits. Ideally all LEGO robotic kits given to the students are complete as if new at the beginning of the season. Get parts from the LEGO group, other sources, or take them from unused kits. Its often useful to select a "parts" kit you can raid, but you'll quickly run out of certain parts.</p>
<p>Mentors may remove easily lost (e.g. small gears), expensive to replace, or distracting (tank treads, rubber bands) parts. Please make those materials available to teams upon request if they have a legitimate need for their project.</p></td>

<td class="why"><p>To save floor space and materials, we generally place 2 arenas together. One 4 foot by 8 foot area typically hosts two teams doing judged runs at the same time.

It should not go far beyond the surface more than a foot, or at the discretion of the judges. Its best to warn the judge and prepare the ground if you plan for your robot to drive around the arena.</p>
<p>If a project has a wall, we do not want robots leaving the arena area enclosed, unless explicitly allowed by the project.</p>
<p>The surface of the competition is generally like a gym floor, but it may be inconsistent when compared to our whiteboard arenas. The competition floor is likely different than the floor when you practice with. That could affect the behavior of your robot.</p>
<p>Also, our arena surfaces typically have a 1/8 inch drop to the floor. Students should be familiar with that, assuming the class uses our standard arena materials. Your robot will need to traverse that. This could be a problem for robots with a "plow" that scrapes the surface or otherwise has low-hanging parts.</p></td>

We'd like to allow creative solutions that leave the arena, but we need to limit chaos and interference that results from the robots driving around.

<li>The robot or item crosses/enters/leaves a boundary.</li>

<p>"Behind a tape line" or "crossing a tape line" means that the Intelligent brick of the robot is not on top of any part of the tape line, as viewed from above.</p>
<p>For projects with specific scoring zones, the robot or item must be over the zone. If some part of puck is over the space of a scoring zone (excluding tape), judge award those points. If the puck is over multiple scoring zones, the points from lowest zone will be used.</p>
<p>Some projects require a robot or some item the robot interacts with to be at a specific place or stop at a specific place by the end of a run. The judge will look straight down from above the arena and ensure the item or robot is over/inside/past the specified boundary.</p>
<p>A robot stopping in a certain position depends on the position of the robot's Intelligent brick only, not the rest of the body of the robot.</p>
<p>Projects where the robot body is considered legal for the stop rule is similar to the rule for the robot fitting within the bounds of a US Letter piece of paper at the beginning of a run for some projects. The "wire squishing" guidance also applies here.</p>
