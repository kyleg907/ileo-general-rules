<ul>
<li>LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Education #9797 (any of the 3 revisions)</li>
<li>LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Education #45544</li>
<li>LEGO SPIKE Prime #45678</li>
</ul>
<p>Other variations of these kits, and LEGO robot generations exist. The home/retail versions we generally allow. We may limit certain parts in those kits to avoid giving an unfair advantage. You may acquire additional parts to bring retail kits in line with the education kits.</p>
<p>For details, see the 'Kit Compatibility Statement.pdf' in the 'Tips, tools, and hints' folder. In it we explain the differences between the kits and what we will and will not allow at the final competition. It will also explain rules for parts swaps that are allowed between kits. The document can be found in the ILEO box site.</p>
<p>No other non_LEGO style/brand of robot is eligible for competition in our program.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>Students might compete against students with different kits. Minimizing those differences keeps competition fair.</p>
<p>Standard kits control costs so the schools.</p>
<p>As always, the education version of the kit is considered to be the gold standard, but some schools have purchased the retail version of the kits in the past and these may be used in the competition, with the restrictions listed in the document.</p>
<p>Lost or broken parts should be replaced, and ideally all LEGO robotic kits given to the students are complete as if new. Parts may be purchased from the LEGO group, other sources, or taken from unused kits. Mentors may remove parts that are too easily lost (small gears), expensive to replace, or are distracting in class (tank treads, rubber bands). But those materials should be made available on team request if they have a legitimate need for the part.</p></td>

The intelligent brick, sensors, and wires ARE considered to be LEGO parts. If there is any question either ask a judge at the competition or contact the core team beforehand.</p></td>

<li>Standard: Open to elementary and middle school students.</li>
<li>Advanced: Open to all students, this is the only level that high school students can compete at.
<ul>
<li>Advanced is hard. If your students have not been in the ILEO program before, we do not recommend placing them in the Advanced division unless they are very familiar with the LEGO Mindstorms platform and have solid problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>If you are not sure, but the students really want to try, have them do the Advanced weekly projects. If they do well there, they will likely be OK with the long-term projects.</li>

<td class="why"><p>To save floor space and materials, we generally place 2 arenas together. One 4 foot by 8 foot area typically hosts two teams doing judged runs at the same time. We generally design projects to its unlikely either run will interfere with the other. But robot designs, or a malfunctioning robot that can reach over the 2x4 walls could interfere.</p></td>

<td class="rule"><p>Typically, before a run starts, the robot must fit in the bounds of an 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch (US Letter) piece of paper. Some projects may specify different dimensions. The wires that connect motors and sensors may go beyond the boundaries as tying them down is difficult and may damage the wires. The wires must still fit in the bounds when you press/squish the wires inward toward the robot.</p>
<p>Once the program is started on the robot, the robot may "unfold" itself and become larger than stated dimensions.</p></td>

<td class="rule"><p>If a project does not include a wall around the area (typically made of 2x4s ), the robot may leave the arena and return to it during a run. However, it should not go far beyond the surface more than a foot, or at the discretion of the judges. Its best to warn the judge and prepare the ground if you plan for your robot to drive around the arena.</p>
<p>If a project has a wall, we do not want robots leaving the arena area enclosed, unless explicitly allowed by the project.</p>
<p>The surface of the competition is generally like a gym floor, but it may be inconsistent when compared to our whiteboard arenas. The competition floor is likely different than the floor when you practice with. All of that could affect the behavior of your robot.</p>
<p>Also, our arena surfaces typically have a 1/8 inch drop to the floor. This should be similar to what students see in class, but your robot will need to traverse that. This could be a problem for robots with a "plow" that scrapes the surface or otherwise has low-hanging parts.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>At times during the competition there may be several people, judges or other materials around the arena. We'd like to allow creative solutions that leave the arena, but we need to limit chaos and interference that results from the robots driving around. Its also hard to tell if a robot is out of control or purposely driving away.</p>
<p>When a project has walls, typically at the competition there will be another arena surface an team competing. We do not want teams competing near each other to interfere with each other.</p></td>

<p>Many projects depend on the position of the robot, or items on the board being at a certain position to be scored. Cases include, but are not limited to:</p>

<li>The robot or an item being "in" or "within" a certain area.</li>
<li>The robot or item crosses/enters/leaves a boundary.</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO in vs completely in Crossing a tape line or entering an area of an arena are based on looking from above the arena straight down.</p>
<p>Completely crossing an obstacle means that the intelligent brick has moved entirely outside of the shaded area shown in the diagram above, after having crossed from one side to the other</p>
<p>"Behind a tape line" or "crossing a tape line" means that the Intelligent brick of the robot is not on top of any part of the tape line, as viewed from above.</p>
<p>If some part of puck is over the white portion of a scoring zone (excluding tape), you will be awarded those points. • If the puck is over multiple scoring zones, the points from lowest zone will be used.</p>
<p>Some projects require a robot or some item the robot interacts with to be at a specific place or stop at a specific place by the end of a run. To determine if this has been accomplished, the judge will look straight down from above the arena and ensure the item or robot is over/inside/past the specified boundary.</p>
<p>Unless the project says otherwise, a robot stopping in a certain position is based on the position of the robot's Intelligent brick only, not the rest of the body of the robot.</p>
<p>Projects where the body is considered legal for the stop rule is similar to the rule for the robot fitting within the bounds of a US Letter piece of paper at the beginning of a run for some projects. The "wire squishing" guidance also applies here. Also, the LEGO parts of the body of the robot must still be attached to the robot's Intelligent brick, unless stated otherwise in the project.</p></td>

<td class="rule">Remind your students to watch the power cables! We have cables running under all the tables to provide power to laptops and kits. These cables are chained together, and every year someone will trip on a cable and accidentally unplug several other tables. Usually, they don't even realize they've done this. If you suddenly lose power, do a quick check to see if your extension cord has become unplugged. Many of the laptops loaned out by IBM have unreliable batteries, so this can be a big problem if it happens during the short-term competition prep time.</td>
