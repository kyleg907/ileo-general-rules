Reach out to the ILEO core team is anything is unclear well before (weeks ahead) the competition to answer any questions, or for a ruling in case other schools/teams have the same questions. Judges and the ILEO core team have the ultimate say in interpreting the rules or handling unexpected situations at the competition.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>We expect students to read and understand the rules of the project and the final competition. Students should ask a mentor for help if anything is unclear. Mentors should reach out to the ILEO core team if anything is unclear to them. We also expect mentors to inform students if they are breaking a rule while practicing in class.</p>
<p>We try to make rules as clear and unambiguous as we can. Unfortunately, we don't always catch every possible corner case or potential point of confusion. If you feel that you have to interpret a rule, or if you have discovered an unintended "loophole", please contact the ILEO core team well ahead (weeks ahead) of the competition to verify your interpretation. If you fail to do so, the ruling of the judge or core team could disappoint your team. We want to avoid such situations for the students.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want you to read between the lines and use that leeway to invent clever solutions. Even in that case we'd like you to also verify your interpretation with the core team.</p></td>

<p>Open to elementary and middle school students. We strongly encourage students who have participated in the program in the past move from beginner to standard.</p>
<p>This is not a strict rule. Mentors, use your best judgement, and (if possible) consult with a teacher who knows the students well. In some cases younger students or students with limited experience with engineering concepts may be better served by a second year in the beginner division.</p>

Open to elementary and middle school students.

<dt>Advanced</dt>
<dd>
Primarily for high school students. High school students may not join beginner nor standard. Open to other students based on ability.
<ul>
<li>Advanced is hard. If your students have not been in the ILEO program before, we do not recommend placing them in the Advanced division unless they are familiar with the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® platform and have solid problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>If you are not sure, but the students really want to try, have them do the Advanced challenge projects that lead up to the final project. If they do well there, they will likely be OK with the long-term projects.</li>

<p>For details, see the 'Kit Compatibility Statement.pdf' in the 'Tips, tools, and hints' folder. In it we explain the differences between the kits and what we will and will not allow at the final competition. It will also explain rules for parts swaps allowed between kits. The document is in the ILEO box folder.</p>
<p>No other non-LEGO style/brand of robot is eligible for competition in our program.</p></td>

<p>Standard kits control costs so the schools.</p>

<p><!-- vale alex.Condescending["easily"] = NO --> Mentors, replace lost or broken parts in the kits. Ideally all LEGO robotic kits given to the students are complete as if new at the beginning of the season. Get parts from the LEGO group, other sources, or take them from unused kits. Its often useful to select a "parts" kit you can raid, but you'll quickly run out of certain parts.</p>
<p>Mentors may remove easily lost (e.g. small gears), expensive to replace, or distracting (tank treads, rubber bands) parts. Please make those materials available to teams upon request if they have a legitimate need for their project.</p></td>

<p>Guiding the robot through human interaction with a sensor such as the ultrasonic sensor, the light sensor, or the sound sensor after the program has started is not allowed. For example, waving your hand over an upward pointing ultrasonic sensor to cause the robot to turn left.</p></td>

<p>If the judge believes this was on purpose, the judge may disqualify the run.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>To save floor space and materials, we generally place two arenas together. One 4 foot by 8 foot surface typically hosts two teams/arenas at the same time.

<p>The wires that connect motors and sensors may go beyond the boundaries. Tying wires down is difficult and may damage the wires. The wires must still fit in the bounds when you gently press/squish the wires inward toward the robot.</p>
<p>If the robot does not fit at the competition, the team must change the robot to fit to attempt a run. This time counts against the available time to perform scored runs with the robot. But really the team must size the robot correctly before arriving at the competition, per <span class="rule-ref">PROG-01</span></p>

<td class="rule"><p>If a project does not include a wall around the arena (typically made of 2×4s ), the robot may leave the arena and return to it during a run. It should not go more than about one foot from the arena.</p>
<p>Judges determine if your robot has moved too far from the arena and may disqualify the run. If your solution does this, warn the judge as you arrive at your arena (before you attempt any runs) so they can prepare the ground, ask people to move, etc.</p>
<p>If a project has a wall, we do not want robots leaving the arena area enclosed, unless explicitly allowed by the project. No part of the robot may extend or move more than 1/2 inch over the top of the wall when viewed from above.</p>
<p>If the robot violates this rule the run will end immediately.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>At times during the competition there may be people, judges or other materials around the arena. We'd like to allow creative solutions that leave the arena, but we need to limit chaos and interference that results. A robot out of control or purposely driving away might look the same to a judge.</p>
<p>At the competition, we try to conserve materials and floor space. When a project has walls, another arena surface and another team might compete on the other side. We do not want teams competing near each other, or observers, to interfere with the teams' runs.</p>
<p>The surface of the competition is generally like a gym floor, but it might be inconsistent when compared to our whiteboard arenas. The competition floor is likely different than the floor you practice with. That could affect the behavior of your robot.</p>
<p>Also, our arena surfaces typically have a 1/8 inch drop to the floor. Students should be familiar with that, assuming the class uses our standard arena materials. Your robot will need to traverse that. This could be a problem for robots with a "plow" that scrapes the surface or otherwise has low-hanging parts.</p></td>

        We need something fair and quick to resolve the situation. We try to
