<li>LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Education #45544</li>
<li>LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime #45678</li>
</ul>
<p>Other variations of these kits, and LEGO robot generations exist. The home/retail versions we generally allow. We may limit certain parts in those kits to avoid giving an unfair advantage. You may add parts to bring retail kits in line with the education kits.</p>
<p>For details, see the 'Kit Compatibility Statement.pdf' in the 'Tips, tools, and hints' folder. In it we explain the differences between the kits and what we will and will not allow at the final competition. It will also explain rules for parts swaps allowed between kits. The document is in the ILEO box folder.</p>
<p>No other non_LEGO style/brand of robot is eligible for competition in our program.</p></td>
<td class="why"><p>Students might compete against students with different kits. Minimizing those differences keeps competition fair.</p>
<p>Standard kits control costs so the schools.</p>
<p>The education version of the kit is the gold standard. Some schools have purchased the retail version of the kits in the past. Such kits are legal at the competition, with the restrictions listed in the document.</p>
<p><!-- vale alex.Condescending["easily"] = NO --> Coaches, replace lost or broken parts in the kits. Ideally all LEGO robotic kits given to the students are complete as if new at the beginning of the season. Get parts from the LEGO group, other sources, or take them from unused kits. Its often useful to select a "parts" kit you can raid, but you'll quickly run out of certain parts.</p>
<p>Mentors may remove easily lost (e.g. small gears), expensive to replace, or distracting (tank treads, rubber bands) parts. Please make those materials available to teams upon request if they have a legitimate need for their project.</p></td>

<p>Said another way, components in the box which are not LEGO pieces (such as the instruction booklet, the part trays, sticker sheet and packaging) are NOT allowed as part of the team's solution.

<td class="why"><p>To save floor space and materials, we generally place 2 arenas together. One 4 foot by 8 foot area typically hosts two teams doing judged runs at the same time.

The wires must still fit in the bounds when you press/squish the wires inward toward the robot.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the team must change the robot to fit. This time counts against the available time to perform scored runs with the robot.</p>

Its best to warn the judge and prepare the ground if you plan for your robot to drive around the arena.</p>
<p>If a project has a wall, we do not want robots leaving the arena area enclosed, unless explicitly allowed by the project.</p>
<p>The surface of the competition is generally like a gym floor, but it may be inconsistent when compared to our whiteboard arenas. The competition floor is likely different than the floor when you practice with. That could affect the behavior of your robot.</p>
<p>Also, our arena surfaces typically have a 1/8 inch drop to the floor. Students should be familiar with that, assuming the class uses our standard arena materials. Your robot will need to traverse that. This could be a problem for robots with a "plow" that scrapes the surface or otherwise has low-hanging parts.</p></td>

We'd like to allow creative solutions that leave the arena, but we need to limit chaos and interference that results from the robots driving around.
